🐍 Python Project Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of Python-based projects created to demonstrate my skills in programming, data handling, and building practical applications. Each project highlights different aspects of Python development, from command-line tools to graphical user interfaces.

📁 Project List
1. Python GUI App (Created May 2025)
🖼️ A desktop graphical application built with Tkinter (or PyQt). Focuses on clean interface design and event-driven programming.
